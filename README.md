# Final Year Project (CSB1)

## Building an AI for Cache Management in Content-Centric Networking


Built under the supervision of Prof. Brahim Bensaou and with assistance from his graduate student Kelvin Chiu

### Description

This work applies time series forecasting as a means to predict content popularity and create a predictive caching strategy.
Unique aspects of this work involve the selection of time-series based features along with content-based features (content categories ex: Film, Politics) and adapting it to caching strategy to improve hit-ratio and hop-reduction
